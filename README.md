# PracticeReactiveJava

Project is to help developers gain Reactive Programming skills and practice coding various reactive operations. 
<br />

This RxJava based playground project gives opportunities for developers to implement various reactive scenarios on underlying database repositories. <br />

<br />

git clone https://github.com/KnowGroup/PracticeReactiveJava.git

<br />

The process to setup and finish implementation of these scenarios shall provide a solid foundation for developers to excel in skills like <br />
-	Reactive Programming using RxJava <br />
-	Coding CURD operations (except delete) for underlying Mongo database <br />
-	Fundamental understanding of model mapping and repository setup for Mongo database <br />
-	Setup Java Gradle based project with Immutable <br />
-	Managing git repositories <br />
 <br />
The project has least data model complexity and has precise code that is required to gain these skills. <br />
 <br />

*No separate MongoDB setup is required, since Fongo has been used as in-memory mongodb.<br />
*Additional Immutable libraries have been used to build immutable type-safe, null-safe and thread-safe objects. <br />
